# flowme

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A little for package to quickly include templates for common project
structures and workflows. Originally based on McBain’s
[`dflow`](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/dflow) and tailored to our
report-generating projects. But we will be including other approaches
here as well.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("edalfon/flowme")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
flowme::drakeme()
```
