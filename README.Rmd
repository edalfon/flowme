# flowme

<!-- badges: start -->

A little for package to quickly include templates for common 
project structures and workflows.
Originally based on McBain's [`dflow`](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/dflow)
and tailored to our report-generating projects. But we will
be including other approaches here as well.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("edalfon/flowme")
```

## [More details](https://edalfon.github.io/flowme/articles/flowme.html)

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")  
}

remotes::install_github("edalfon/flowme")

flowme::drakeme()

drake::r_make()


```
