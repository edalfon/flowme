A little for package to quickly include templates for common 
project structures and workflows.
Originally based on McBain's [`dflow`](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/dflow)
and tailored to our report-generating projects. But we will
be including other approaches here as well.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("edalfon/flowme")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
flowme::drakeme()
```
